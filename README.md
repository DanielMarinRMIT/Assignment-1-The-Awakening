# Assignment-1: Make Some Art or Something: Professional Edition 2018

Here is my program for Assingment 1. 

To run these processing files properly, you will need to rename the root folder MSAOS_2018.

My program essentially attempts to imitate the classic paint program. Functions and aesthetics are inspired by Microsoft Paint from the 90’s and the early 2000’s, and comprise of intermediate greys, and boxy bevelled edges. Parodying some professional design programs, I named my software Make Some Art or Something: Professional Edition 2018, and the first thing you’ll see when you open the program is a splash screen that displays this name in a logo form, and the logo of the developer underneath, which I just simply named SoftwareSoft. 

Once the splash screen disappears after a 3 second timer, the programs UI and a blank canvas will generate. Here the user can begin creating a work of art! Several tools are available to the user by clicking on tool icons spread across the dashboard at the top of the screen. Tools include: 

*	New Canvas Tool: Generates a new blank canvas.
*	New Coloured Canvas Tool: Generates a new coloured canvas based on the user defined colour.
*	Pencil Tool: A tool that draws based on the stroke weight and user defined colour.
*	Eraser Tool: A tool that draws white at a larger stroke weight than the pencil.
*	Paint-brush Tool: A tool that draws based on a dynamic stroke weight to create brush strokes.
*	Rectangle Tool: A tool that draws rectangles with the fill colour defined by the user.
*	Ellipse Tool: A tool that draws ellipses with the fill colour defined by the user.
*	Line Tool: A tool that draws a line that will have a user defined stroke colour.
*	Spray Can Tool: A tool that draws a spray image tinted by the user defined colour.
*	Eye-dropper Tool: A tool that will get the colour of any pixel selected within the frame. 

Additionally, there are also several buttons that control the colour and stroke weight of some of the tools that can be used. Plus, and minus buttons will add and subtract weight, hue, saturation, and brightness for the tool being used by the user. The changes to these properties are displayed within several spectrums (loops), which indicate what changes will be made if the property is modified. The stroke weight is displayed by a corresponding ellipse. 

Once an artwork has been created by the user, they are welcome to save their file as a JPEG.
Thanks for reading, you’re now all set to make some art or something with Make Some of Something: Professional Edition 2018!
